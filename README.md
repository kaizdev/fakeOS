## Objectives

Consolidate understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by creating a fakeOS. I have chosen the iOS operating system for it's modern and sleek design philosophy.

## Instructions

-   As this is an iPhone simulation, the best results will be from using an iPhone viewport. On wider screens, the iPhone view will be simulated using `@media screen`
-   Open apps by clicking on them - this will open them in a modal. Note that only the apps on the desktop will open for this MVP (not the apps on the bottom row)
-   Close an app by pressing the back button (to go back to the home page)
